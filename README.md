## What is this?
This is my first project for SIS-2420.

This app allows you to view, edit, and create your JSON like files (only .json files are supported for now), it enables a view where you can easily edit the current file without having to struggle so much as with editing the actual file and also makes it easy to manipulate any kind of properties that you have in.

## Download the App
Coming soon!

## Quick Development

> [!NOTE]
> This project is multiplatform

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to have Rust installed!

You can also see [Tauri's Prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)

1. You can start by installing all the dependecies in the project with your package manager (we're using bun in this), so just run:

```bash
bun install
```

2. And then for a quick development in desktop just run:

```bash
bun run tauri dev
```

And you're ready to go!
